### Technology

We made a golf app for users who would want to fill in other peoples' tee times or even combine them. In every profile each user would have to put their handicap to show others how experienced they are in golf. The languages our group used were javascript, html, and css. We did use the MEAN stack to create this app.

### How We Made Our Website

We worked in collaboration with the UX team for this project.  Everyday we would meet with them to go over any issues were faced with.  We got the wireframe from them and as we got closer to finishing with the backend, we began styling on the front-end to make it look as similar to the wireframes they provided to us.

While they were working on the wireframes, we ran into a wide variety of issues from setting up the Yelp API to grabbing information from referenced models using mongoose. Overall, it was a great learning experience and we had a lot of fun doing this project.
